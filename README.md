# rock-paper-scissors
Greetings everyone. This is a small Rock Paper Scissors project I did as a hobby.
So basically there are two versions of the game.
  1. game.js
  2. gameWithUI.js
The game.js version is a console version of the game. In order to play it, just open index2.html in your browser. Open the console. Now you can start typing in the prompt to play the game. Your choice is not case-sensitive(rock, ROCK, RoCk, ROck means the same thing). First to reach 5 points wins the game.

The gameWithUI.js has a minimal UI attached to it. In order to play it, open index.html in your browser. You can play this version just by tapping on the pictures. First to reach 10 points wins the game.

Have fun :D
